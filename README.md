## Building

### Requirements
* [ScriptHookV SDK by Alexander Blade](http://www.dev-c.com/gtav/scripthookv/)
* [GTAVMenuBase](https://github.com/E66666666/GTAVMenuBase)

Download the [ScriptHookV SDK](http://www.dev-c.com/gtav/scripthookv/) and extract its contents to ScriptHookV_SDK.

Clone this repository to the same folder ScriptHookV_SDK was extracted so you have ScriptHookV_SDK and this in the same folder. If you get build errors about missing functions, update your [natives.h](hhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/E66666666/GTAVMenuBase/master/thirdparty/scripthookv-sdk-updates/natives.h).

Clone my [GTAVMenuBase](https://github.com/E66666666/GTAVMenuBase) to the same folder you're gonna clone this to.
